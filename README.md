# Programming Center Website 

Programming Center Website README

Introduction
Many Computer Science Engineering (CSE) students at Yanbu Industrial College (YIC) face difficulties in some subjects. To address this issue, the CSE department has established
a Programming Center that provides students with extra help sessions outside of class time. However, the current booking process for
the programming center is inefficient, as students have to fill out a Google form for each session and provide academic information
for each appointment. To improve the experience for students and teachers, our team has developed a website for the Programming Center 
that allows for easy booking of sessions, as well as providing additional services like workshops, volunteer applications,
and CSE course resources.

Problem
Students at YIC face a problem when trying to use the programming center services.
They don't have a clear understanding of how it works or what the programming center can provide to help them with their studies. 
The current process uses Google Forms, which can be confusing and time-consuming for students, and many students face issues when
trying to view or book sessions.

Solution

- Provides a user-friendly and efficient platform for students and teachers to book sessions and access additional resources.
- Allows students to easily view all available upcoming sessions and enroll in one that matches their schedule and course.
- Offers the option for students to book an appointment with a teacher or volunteer student if they cannot find a suitable session.
- Provides the ability for students to offer help sessions to others in the Programming Center by filling out a volunteer application.
- Allows teachers to edit their upcoming sessions or table at any time and review any appointments that are booked by students.
- Allows students and teachers to view upcoming workshops 
- Allows students and teachers to apply for hosting a workshop 
- Allows admin to add/remove workshop and accept/decline workshop/volunteer applications
- Allows students and teachers to use a chatbot to gain resources for their courses

Conclusion
The Programming Center website is a user-friendly and efficient platform that provides CSE students at YIC
with access to extra help sessions and additional resources. It is designed to support the core goal of the enterprise and
provides critical functionality that helps the enterprise achieve its objectives and goals. Our team hopes that this website will 
improve the experience for both students and teachers and enhance the overall effectiveness of the Programming Center.
